## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack developer based out of Cape Town, South Africa! (or somewhere on Planet Earth.) <br/>
You can find me geeking out on new tech whilst bouncing off the walls due to a coffee addiction. *Espresso Please!* :coffee: <br/>


I on ocassion tell really bad dad jokes!

*Clears Throat* <br/>

Me: What do you call a laptop that sings?<br/>
Audience:...<br/>
Me:...<br/>
Audience:...<br/>
Me: A Dell! <br/>
